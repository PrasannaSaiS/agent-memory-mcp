## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- **Production Readiness Audit:** Complete v1.0.0 production verification suite across documentation truth, security, reliability, scale, and cross-platform consistency (`docs/production-readiness-audit.md`).
- **Startup Environment Validation:** Added `validateStartupEnvironment` checking `AGENT_MEMORY_DIR` directory validity and `AGENT_MEMORY_REPO` non-empty constraint. Emits machine-readable JSON on `stderr` and exits code 1 on failure while preserving clean `stdout`.
- **Node.js Version Enforcement:** Added runtime check enforcing Node.js `>= 22.5.0` (required for native `node:sqlite DatabaseSync`). Emits structured error on `stderr` when executed on unsupported engines.
- **Cross-Platform Path Normalization:** Enhanced `normalizeOutput` to canonicalize Windows drive letters (`C:\` -> `C:/`), relative prefixes (`.\` -> `./`), and path backslashes to forward slashes. Produces byte-for-byte identical fingerprints across Windows and POSIX.
- **Homoglyph Normalization:** Implemented `HOMOGLYPH_MAP` and `canonicalizeHomoglyphs` in `poisonDetector.ts` mapping Cyrillic and Greek lookalikes to Latin equivalents and stripping zero-width spaces before heuristic analysis.
- **Command Policy Hardening:** Added strict argument path containment blocking workspace escapes via absolute paths or `--flag=value` syntax. Hardened `hasResolvedApproval` with per-line JSON recovery and approval ID to command binding.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Added `shutdown` function handling `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` to finalize open SQLite connections and flush logs.
- **Scale Benchmarks:** Added `scripts/scale-benchmark.ts` evaluating performance at 100, 1,000, and 10,000 records. Verified exact lookup p95 is 25.08 ms at 1k and 128.10 ms at 10k records.
- **Packaging & CI:** Added npm metadata (`bin`, `files`, `repository`), GitHub Actions CI workflow, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [0.8.0] - Phase 8: Benchmark & Evaluation
- Built deterministic evaluation harness with 6 real-world fault scenarios (dependency mismatch, TypeScript compilation error, missing env var, port collision, test assertion failure, platform path separator).
- Implemented automated comparative baselines B0 (no memory), B1 (exact only), B2 (exact + fuzzy), and B3 (full system with staleness).
- Applied non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank paired hypothesis testing ($W^+$, two-tailed $p$-values) and rank-biserial effect sizes ($r$).

---

## [0.7.0] - Phase 7: Integration and UX
- Added MCP prompt `agent_memory_safe_workflow` outlining the safe 8-step repair workflow.
- Added `memory://records/{id}` MCP resource template and recent resource enumeration.
- Aligned `list_memory_stats` tool output with the Memory Console overview contract.
- Published operator user guide and MCP host integration manuals (`docs/operations/user-guide.md`).

---

## [0.6.0] - Phase 6: Memory Console Dashboard
- Built `dashboard-bridge` Node service using Fastify, strictly isolated and bound to `127.0.0.1`. Enforces read-only SQLite queries and append-only operator decision logging.
- Built `dashboard-frontend` React + Vite console featuring seven views: Overview, Live Activity Feed, Record Browser & Detail, Retrieval Explainability, Approval Queue, Security Audit, and Benchmark Results.
- Added static AST isolation tests proving bridge cannot import or execute shell processes.

---

## [0.5.0] - Phase 5: Retrieval Poisoning Defenses
- Designed and verified 7 heuristic prompt injection detectors (imperative injection, authority override, system prompt delimiters, exfiltration URLs, code fence smuggling, zero-width characters, homoglyphs).
- Implemented untrusted data wrapping via `<untrusted_historical_memory>` envelopes with explicit `<warning>` delimiters.
- Added quarantine flagging (`is_quarantined = true`), quarantine audit reasons, and provenance-weighted trust decay.

---

## [0.4.0] - Phase 4: Sandboxed Verification & Policy Engine
- Implemented `verify_fix` tool for safe repair validation.
- Built `CommandPolicyEngine` enforcing strict binary allowlist (`npm`, `cargo`, `vitest`, etc.) and permanently disallowing destructive commands (`rm`, `sudo`, `git reset --hard`).
- Implemented two-tier human operator approval queue via `.agent-memory/approvals-pending.jsonl` and `.agent-memory/approvals-resolved.jsonl`.

---

## [0.3.0] - Phase 3: Fuzzy Matching & Output Normalization
- Implemented versioned output normalizer v1 stripping volatile runtime noise (ISO timestamps, UUIDs, memory addresses, durations, temp paths).
- Built token-overlap and Levenshtein similarity ranking with configurable confidence thresholds.
- Dynamic Wilson score interval confidence calculation for historical records.

---

## [0.2.0] - Phase 2: Core Vertical Slice
- Implemented `record_failure` and `find_fix` MCP tools.
- Deterministic SHA-256 fingerprinting of normalized errors.
- Two-layer credential redaction engine: deterministic regex for known API keys plus Shannon entropy gating ($H(X) \ge 4.5\text{ bits/char}$).
- Hybrid storage engine: authoritative append-only `records.jsonl` with SQLite `index.db` secondary search cache.

---

## [0.1.0] - Phase 1: Architecture & Foundations
- Initial architecture specifications, ADR-001 through ADR-007.
- Zod schema validation contracts for MCP tools and data types.
- Stdio channel invariant enforcement (zero `stdout` pollution, JSON-RPC framing strictly preserved).
